XP System
The the main currency (XP), tracks every user's own amount
The second (premium) currency is peaches
XP is always displayed as a total (i.e. he has 14 XP, she has 201,441,089 XP)
Restricted command which allows me to give XP
Restricted command which allows me to remove XP
Restricted command which allows me to give peaches
Restricted command which allows me to remove peaches
Restricted command which allows me to set the message of the day (current task(s), for example)
The minimum XP is 0, a user cannot go below that.

User commands
An "motd" (rename this?) command which displays the message of the day
A "grind" command: Awards 1000-1500 XP (random within range), can be used once every hour max. Displays quaint message from a list like:
"You slayed a slime! Now you're all sticky..."
"Barely defeated that bone witch. Your boner almost got in your way..."
"Those imps were such a tease, but you managed to stay focused."
"Those spirits licked and rubbed you through your armour, you almost came!"
(let me define these with a command or something)
A "seduce @user" command: Initiates the seduction system if the other user accepts by reacting with the correct emoji (ðŸ’¦)
A "drain" (ðŸ‘…) command: Transfers 10% of the other user's XP to your own XP pool.
A "surrender" command: Gives the user two options, selectable by emoji reaction:
Admit Defeat (ðŸ˜–): Transfer 50% of your XP.
Admit Total Defeat (ðŸ¥µ): Transfer 100% of your XP.

Leveling / Ranking System
Each time the XP of a user changes, it updates their level if necessary.
Allow me to define minimum level requirements for "rank-ups" which award a new (definable) role.
If you lose levels, your rank role updates accordingly.

Seduction System
Seduce, Surrender, and Drain commands as listed above.
(Users are expected to chat and send pictures to each other, the bot is not involved in this).
